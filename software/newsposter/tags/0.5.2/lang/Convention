Convention and notes for translation contributors:

 - copy the de_DE.php file (this should be the latest) and rename it
   (e.g. fr.php)

 - replace all the german values, the translator note and save your file
   utf-8 encoded

 - %s in $lang elements is a conversion specification for sprintf
   functions (http://www.php.net/sprintf)

 - to use your translation you have to add the ISO-639 two-letter
   language code to the $avail_lang array in include/i18n.php
