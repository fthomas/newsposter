DO NOT EDIT the mbox file manually, this can cause
fatal errors! Use Newsposter instead.

If you still want to edit it manually, notice this:
    
    - remove overview file after changing mbox file
      (a new one will be created automaticly the next time
      invoking NP_Storing)
    
    - adjust the lines-header, if you change the number of
      newlines in a message body. If you don't, the mbox file
      is corrupted and Newsposter won't be able to read it!

If something goes wrong, I have warned you!

It is safe to edit/delete the following files:
    WARNING.txt
    blacklist.txt    
    error.log    
    feed_atom03.xml
    feed_rss10.rdf
    feed_rss20.xml
    mbox.bak
    overview_fs.bak
