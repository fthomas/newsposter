Upgrade from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2:
----------------------------
  Just copy your spool directory into the new Newsposter
  directory. You have to adjust the new config, since there
  are new options and others were renamed. These are:
    
  New config options:
    
    $cfg['ContentNegotiation']
    
  Renamed config options:
    
    $cfg['RDFCreation']        renamed to $cfg['CreateFeeds']
    
    $cfg['RDFIncludeComments'] renamed to $cfg['IncludeComments']
     
    $cfg['RDFDescription']     renamed to $cfg['Description']
     
    $cfg['RDFMaxItems']        renamed to $cfg['MaxFeedItems']

  If you are using a customized translation for Newsposter, you
  have to rename your language file to xx.php where xx is a
  ISO-639 two-letter language code. Then open the include/i18n.php
  file and add xx to the $avail_lang array.
