     4. First Steps


 1. Prerequisite
 ---------------

 There are two software packages needed by Newsposter.
   - Web Server which interprets PHP
   - PHP >= 4.2.0 (developed with PHP >= 4.2.3)
     - compiled with session support
     - for hashed passwords PHP's mhash extension is needed


 2. Installation
 ---------------

 Unpack the Newsposter archive to your web directory and
 make sure the spool directory inside the Newsposter
 directory is writeable for the webserver.
 
 For the Gzip archive under a unix environment this should
 look like this:

     tar -zxf newsposter-0.5.x.tar.gz
     cp -r newsposter-0.5.x /var/www/homepage/newsposter
     chown www-data /var/www/homepage/newsposter/spool
    
 You can check if your system is ready to run Newsposter with
 the 'test_conf.php' script in the tools/ directory.


 3. Configuration
 ----------------

 Now you have to configure your Newsposter. For this open
 the config.php file in the Newsposter directory with an
 ordinary text editor. The config.php file contains valid
 PHP code, so be careful not to corrupt the code while
 editing this file. Now go through the entire file and
 customize the configuration to your needs.

 There is only one configuration value you have to change
 if you want Newsposter to work correctly: 'IndexURL'

 To integrate all of Newsposter's HTML output into your
 page, look at the 'IncludeHeader' and 'IncludeFooter'
 options.
 

 4. First Steps
 --------------

 Now you can begin to use Newsposter. Surf to Newsposter's
 index.php file with your web browser. With the Get parameter
 "np_act" you can reach for the different functions of

	 some time.
    	
     index.php?np_act=output_all
	 Here are up to $cfg['MaxItems'] postings showed. This
	 should be used for daily use.

     index.php?np_act=search
	 If you want to search for a string in all of your postings,
	 news or comments, this is for you.
		
     index.php?np_act=oview
	 This is an overview of all news and comments of your
	 Newsposter to surf to singel postings quickly.
