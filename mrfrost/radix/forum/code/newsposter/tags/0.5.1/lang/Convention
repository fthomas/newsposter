Convention and notes for translation contributors:

 - copy the german.php file (this should be the latest) and rename it
   (e.g. greek.php)

 - replace all the german values, the translator note and save your file
   utf-8 encoded

 - incomplete/deprecated files will begin with an underscored
   (e.g. _french.php)

 - %s in $lang elements is a conversion specification for sprintf
   functions (http://www.php.net/sprintf)
