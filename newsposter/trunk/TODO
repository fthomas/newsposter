- LDAP authentication needs admin rights
  -> every LDAP user should use it

- if the mhash extension of the installed PHP version is buggy
  the passwords scripts end with "server not found" (PHP then
  segfaults).
  -> document this behaviour

- no handbook yet
  -> guess what!

- if users reload after they posted a comment, it may be posted twice
  -> prevent this

- search strings in hrefs are marked too
  -> prevent it or mark the descriptional text of the hyperlink
     (what to do if this is an image?)

- if comments and the referral posting are send/edited at the same
  time, the comment do not have a reference 

- test_conf don't check whether IndexURL was set correctly
