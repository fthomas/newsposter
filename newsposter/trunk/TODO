- LDAP authentication needs admin rights
  -> every LDAP user should use it

- np_act=auth_err sends email on every hit
  -> write blacklist class like in Newsposter 0.4.x

- tools/pass_shell.php needs /usr/bin/php. Some distributions
  might call the php binary "php4".
  -> make a note in the documentation

- if the mhash extension of the installed PHP version is buggy
  the passwords scripts end with "server not found" (PHP then
  segfaults).
  -> document this behaviour

- update_data.php incomplete
  -> guess what!
